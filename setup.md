### Webpack

* not runtime, only build time. It's a tool

* `npm install -D webpack` (capital D means --save-dev)

* [Webpack getting started](https://webpack.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started/)

* webpack makes it so everything can be required without having to manually do it (there is one script tag in html)
* webpack will look in node_modules for dependencies
*  `npm i -S angular angular-material angular-animate angular-aria angular-messages angular-ui-router`
* [angular-ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/blob/master/package.json)
* `npm install webpack-dev-server -D`
* `"start": "webpack-dev-server --progress --colors"`
* `npm start`
