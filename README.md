# Project description

M.A.P.S - Multidisciplinary Association of Practicing Scientists

## Who uses it? 

* People who want to learn things and build things

## What problem does it solve?
 
* A lot of people who don't know how to program don't even try because they don't think they are smart enough. This app will help overcome that barrier by making the learning and building of things gamified every step of the way.

### What outputs do they need?

* Quests (things to build)
* Lesson plans (treasure maps)
* Customized 3D avatar
* Engagement graph

### What inputs are needed to generate those outputs?

* User info
* User preferences

## Technologies you plan to use

* JavaScript
* Java
* Webpack
* Pivotal Cloud Foundry
* Angular
* Material Design
* Google Calendar
* Twilio
* MySQL
* Passport.js
* D3.js


## Feature list

* Authentication with Passport + Google OAuth
* Dashboard with Material Design
* A way to upload new quests
* A way to upload new maps
* A way to get unblocked: Scientific method questionnaire (Users are encouraged to come up with theories and test them. A submission can start a discussion amongst other budding programmers/scientists who can offer ideas. A submission will also send notification to moderators who can assist / point them in the right direction)

## Stretch goals
 
* Make an AR / VR game
* Unity
* Blender
